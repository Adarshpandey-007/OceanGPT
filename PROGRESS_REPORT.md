## 4. Error & Build Notes

### Session 1 (Initial UI Overhaul)
- Resolved missing TypeScript types for `pg` by adding `@types/pg`.
- Introduced global & route error boundaries to eliminate runtime warning: "missing required error components".
- Terminal build output appeared suppressed during later clean builds—no TypeScript errors surfaced in changed files.

### Session 2 (Bug Fixes & Infrastructure - Oct 2, 2025)

#### Critical Bug: Infinite Render Loop Causing All Buttons to Fail
**Symptom:** All interactive buttons (landing page, upload page) completely unresponsive. Browser console flooded with 1000+ "Maximum update depth exceeded" warnings.

**Root Cause:** `BubbleBackground` component had faulty useEffect dependency array:
```tsx
// BROKEN:
useEffect(() => {
  setBubbles(seeds);
}, [count, disableAnimation, sizeRange]); // ❌ sizeRange = [6,24] new array ref every render
```

**Impact:** 
- Infinite render loop crashed React reconciler
- Event handlers never attached to DOM
- Page appeared static but non-interactive
- Error cascaded to all pages using Hero component

**Fix:** Changed dependency to track primitive values instead of array reference:
```tsx
// FIXED:
useEffect(() => {
  setBubbles(seeds);
}, [count, disableAnimation, sizeRange[0], sizeRange[1]]); // ✅ Stable primitives
```

**Files Modified:** `src/components/decor/BubbleBackground.tsx`

#### Build System Issues & Resolution
**Symptom:** 404 errors for Next.js chunks (`main-app.js`, `app-pages-internals.js`), font assets, and service-worker.js.

**Actions Taken:**
1. Deep clean: Deleted `.next`, `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`
2. Killed locked Node processes preventing deletion
3. Fresh `npm install` to regenerate all dependencies
4. Created stub `public/service-worker.js` to silence harmless 404

**Outcome:** Clean compilation, all chunks serving correctly with 200 status.

#### Test Infrastructure Expansion
**Added:**
- Admin dashboard component (`src/components/admin/AdminStatCard.tsx`)
- Admin page with live stats (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)

- Polyfilled `fetch`, `Request`, `Response` for Next.js API route tests
- Implemented static `Response.json()` for Node 18 compatibility
- Configured `ts-jest` with proper JSX transform

**Test Results:** 42/42 tests passing (12 test suites)

#### Upload Page Enhancements

## 8. Potential Next Enhancements
| Priority | Enhancement | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| High | Monitoring/logging integration (e.g., Sentry scaffold) | Production observability |
| High | Loading & skeleton states for charts / stats | Perceived performance |
| Medium | Theme toggle (high-contrast / daylight) | Accessibility & adaptability |
| Medium | Plotly theme sync with Tailwind tokens | Visual coherence in data viz |
| Medium | Jest smoke tests for error boundaries | Regression safety |
| Low | Automated a11y audit CI (axe / pa11y) | Continuous accessibility QA |
| Low | Extract repeated utility clusters into plugin | Maintainability |

## 9. Maintenance Guidelines
- Limit accent gradient usage to primary CTAs (≤2 per viewport)
- Re-run contrast checks after palette changes
- Update `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` with any new semantic tokens immediately upon introduction
- Keep animations subtle: durations ≥ 18s for ambient loops; avoid parallax stacking

## 10. Handoff Notes
The system is ready for iterative feature expansion (e.g., advanced query semantics, vector search) without further foundational UI work. Adopt incremental enhancement strategy: introduce new components within defined panel & token patterns, then document deltas in the design system.

## 11. Session 3 - Presentation Stabilization (2026-04-13)

### Objective
Prepare a demo-safe build for presentation with emphasis on visible reliability, graceful failure handling, and traceable progress logs.

### Commands Executed
```bash
npm run lint
npm test -- --runInBand
npm run build
```

### Results Snapshot
- Lint: no blocking errors after fixes (remaining warnings only, primarily no-console and one hook dependency warning in upload page).
- Tests: 12/12 suites passed, 42/42 tests passed.
- Build: command started successfully; terminal capture did not return final completion text in this session window and should be re-confirmed in a local terminal before final demo lock.

### Stabilization Fixes Applied
1. Upload lint blocker fixed:
  - Reworded unescaped apostrophe in `src/app/upload/page.tsx` to satisfy `react/no-unescaped-entities`.
2. Map panel resilience improved:
  - Added request cancellation via `AbortController` for `/api/floats` fetch.
  - Added user-visible map data error banner instead of silent console-only failure.
  - Removed marker click console logging noise.
  - File: `src/components/visualizations/MapPanel.tsx`.
3. Table panel reliability improved:
  - Added loading, empty, and error states.
  - Added response status checks and abort-safe fetch cleanup.
  - File: `src/components/visualizations/TablePanel.tsx`.
4. Real profile fetch hardening:
  - Added timeout support (default 10s).
  - Added abort signal propagation and deterministic cleanup in `finally`.
  - File: `src/lib/real/fetchRealProfile.ts`.
5. Plot panel stale-request prevention:
  - Added abortable mock profile loading flow.
  - Added abort controller lifecycle management for real profile loads.
  - Added clearer no-data/error fallback text when profile data is unavailable.
  - File: `src/components/visualizations/PlotPanel.tsx`.
6. README presentation readiness:
  - Added dedicated 15+ minute demo runbook and fallback script.
  - Removed duplicated secondary README block to improve clarity.
  - File: `README.md`.

### Residual Risks (Pre-Demo)
- `npm run build` completion output should be confirmed once in an interactive terminal before final sign-off.
- Non-blocking lint warnings remain in diagnostic/debug-oriented areas.

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Re-run `npm run build` in local interactive terminal and confirm success line.
2. Execute manual smoke run across `/`, `/app`, `/upload`, `/admin`, `/about`.
3. Rehearse the new README demo runbook end-to-end once without interruption.

### Runtime Incident Log (Dev Server Not Loading)
**Symptom observed:** `next dev` displayed `Starting...` while browser screen stayed blank and console looked idle.

**Root cause identified:** stale orphan Node/Next processes were occupying both 3000 and 3001, causing confusing startup behavior across multiple terminals.

**Diagnostic steps executed:**
```bash
for %p in (3000 3001) do @echo ==== PORT %p ==== & netstat -ano | findstr :%p
for %i in (21776 1496) do @echo ==== PID %i ==== & tasklist /FI "PID eq %i"
```

**Remediation executed:**
```bash
taskkill /PID 21776 /F
taskkill /PID 1496 /F
npm run dev -- -p 3000
```

**Verification executed:**
```bash
for %p in (/ /app /upload /admin /about /api/health /api/profiles /api/floats) do @curl -s -o NUL -w "%p -> %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3000%p
```

**Verification result:** all core routes returned HTTP 200.

**Additional observation:** Gemini API key in environment is suspended (403). App still responds via fallback path; no blocker for demo if LLM-specific claims are avoided.

### Map Runtime Crash Fix (Leaflet icon)
**Symptom observed:** map rendered error overlay and runtime exception:
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createIcon')`.

**Root cause identified:** `Marker` received `icon={undefined}` for non-focused markers; Leaflet then attempted to call `createIcon` on an undefined icon object.

**Fix applied:** only pass `icon` prop when a valid icon exists.

**File updated:** `src/components/visualizations/MapPanel.tsx`

**Verification:** TypeScript/IDE error scan reports no errors in updated file.

## 12. Checkpoint Summary (2026-04-13, Late Session)

### Completed in this checkpoint
- Baseline checks executed (lint, tests, build command run).
- Demo-critical runtime fixes shipped (map/table/plot/fetch resilience).
- Dev server startup incident diagnosed and resolved (stale Node processes on 3000/3001).
- Core route health verified with HTTP 200 for main pages and key APIs.
- Leaflet marker icon runtime crash fixed in map rendering path.
- README upgraded with a presentation runbook and fallback flow.

### Current Stability Status
- Test status: **PASS** (42/42 tests, 12/12 suites).
- Lint status: **PASS with warnings** (non-blocking warnings remain).
- Runtime status: **PASS** for `/`, `/app`, `/upload`, `/admin`, `/about`, `/api/health`, `/api/profiles`, `/api/floats`.
- Map status: **PASS after icon-prop fix** (no type errors in updated file).

### Pending for Final Validation Pass
1. Reconfirm one clean `npm run build` completion output in an interactive terminal.
2. Perform one uninterrupted rehearsal using the README demo sequence.
3. Validate Real mode behavior with a known float id and fallback to Mock mode if needed.

### Presentation Guidance
- Keep dev server on a fixed port (`3000`) during rehearsal and demo.
- Avoid LLM live claims unless Gemini key is replaced and validated.
- If map tiles are slow, pivot to plot/table first and return to map after warm-up.

## 13. Session 4 - SIH 25040 Alignment & Gap Analysis (2026-04-27)

### Objective
Analyze the current MVP against the official SIH 25040 Problem Statement to identify gaps and formulate a fast-track completion plan.

### Alignment Status
The current UI/UX (chat interface, map, depth-time plots, tabular summaries) is highly aligned with the expected frontend deliverables. However, the backend is currently relying on mock data, JSON caches, and a regex-based intent router. 

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: The PS explicitly requires using MCP. We currently have no MCP implementation.
2. **Vector Database**: The PS explicitly mentions FAISS/Chroma. While the schema includes `pgvector`, we must integrate ChromaDB or FAISS to strictly meet the requirement.
3. **NetCDF to SQL Pipeline**: Current ingestion only writes to JSON. We must write real ARGO data directly to PostgreSQL/PostGIS.
4. **RAG + NL2SQL Pipeline**: We need a true LLM-driven RAG pipeline that interprets natural language and securely executes SQL against our PostGIS database using MCP tools.
5. **Data Export**: The UI needs ASCII/NetCDF export options for the tabular summaries.
6. **Data Source**: We must transition from mock data to real Indian Ocean ARGO NetCDF files to demonstrate a valid PoC.

### Next Steps
An updated Fast-Track Implementation Plan has been created to address these gaps, focusing on standing up a Python-based MCP Server, integrating ChromaDB, completing the Postgres ingestion script, and wiring the Next.js frontend as an MCP Client.
